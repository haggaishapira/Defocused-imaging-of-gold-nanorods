%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   IMPORTANT NOTICE
%
%   This sample only works with a PI_MATLAB_Driver version 1.5.0 and newer.
% 
%   You must always initialize the system first. The steps necessary depend on the type of mechanics (e.g., positioner, actuator) 
%   and electronics (e.g., controller, drive electronics). 
%   It may be necessary to load positioner parameters from a database and/or perform a homing procedure (e.g., auto zero procedure, reference move).
%   Refer to the manuals of your mechanics and electronics for details.
%
%   For the initialization use PIMikroMove on Windows or PITerminal on Linux.
%
%   - Load positioner parameters via "Start Up Controller" in PIMikroMove 
%   or via the CST command in PITerminal. 
%
%   - Execute the homing procedure in PIMikroMove via "Start Up Controller" -> "Start up axes".
%   Alternatively, use the corresponding sample (AutoZeroSample, ReferenceSample, ReferenceWithEAXSample). 
%
%   To check if the PI_MATLAB_Driver works properly, run the sample 
%   BeginWithThisSampleForTestingMatlabDriver.m

%   !! MOTION WARNING !!
%    
%   Description:
%
%   This sample loads the MATLAB driver and connects a controller using TCP/IP, USB or RS232.
%   It shows how to determine min/max position limits, also how to do absolute and relative motions.
%   
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Setup configuration

% You MUST EDIT AND ACTIVATE the parameters to make your system run
% properly.
% 1. Activate the connection type
% 2. Set the connection settings

% Connection type
use_RS232_Connection                = false;
use_TCPIP_Connection                = true;
use_USB_Connection                  = false;

% Connection settings
% RS232
comPort = 1;          % Look at the Device Manager to get the correct COM Port
baudRate = 115200;    % Look at the manual to get the correct baud rate for your controller
% USB
controllerSerialNumber = 'Enter valid serial number here, e.g. "123456789"'; % Use "devicesUsb = Controller.EnumerateUSB('')" to get all PI controller connected to your PC. Or look at the label of the case of your controller
% TCP/IP
ip = 'XXX.XXX.XXX.XX'; % Use "devicesTcpIp = Controller.EnumerateTCPIPDevices('')" to get all PI controller available on the network
port = 50000;          % Is 50000 for almost all PI controllers


% Please choose the right configuration for your setup, 
% there is one common configuration working with most of PI controllers 
% and one configuration for the Hexapod controller C-887
